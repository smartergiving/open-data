# SmarterGiving :: open-data
**Summary**  
A completely open, git-driven database of nonprofit information.

**Goal**  
Provide designers and developers the tools needed to innovate at all levels of the 'charity stack'.

**Background**  
We firmly believe nonprofit and charitable data shouldn't be stuck behind paywalls. We grew tired of running into roadblocks finding machine-readable data that was NOT kept hostage by a paywall so decided to do something about it.

### Under Active Development
While you are free to use any of the data for any purpose, know that the data, file structure, and every other component are subject to change.
