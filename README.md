# SmarterGiving :: Open-Data
**Summary**  
A completely open, git-driven database of nonprofit information.

**Purpose**  
Provide designers and developers the tools and data needed to experiment and innovate at all levels of the 'charity stack'.

**Background**  
We firmly believe nonprofit and charitable data shouldn't be stuck behind paywalls. As developers, we grew tired of running into roadblocks finding machine-readable data that was NOT kept hostage by a paywall, so we decided to do something about it.
