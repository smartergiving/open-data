# SmarterGiving :: open-data
**Summary**
A completely open, git-driven database of nonprofit information.

**Goal**
Provide designers and developers the tools needed to innovate at all levels of the 'charity stack'.

**Background**
We firmly believe nonprofit and charitable data shouldn't be stuck behind paywalls. We grew tired of running into roadblocks finding machine-readable data that was NOT kept hostage by a paywall so decided to do something about it.

*Note: This project is in the 'pre-alpha' stage, so keep in mind the data, schema, file structure, and every other component are likely to change.*
