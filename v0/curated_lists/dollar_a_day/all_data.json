With more than five decades now under their belt, it would be easy to call their mission a (big) success. Today, they continue to offer live programming, publications, events, and workshops to an array of writers both contemporary and established. They also host an annual marathon reading on New Year's Eve, archive their work with Library of Congress, and — most importantly — offer continual encouragement to hundreds of budding writers. — picked by Cassie M., who heads up day-to-day.

Founded in 1973 by a group of female co-workers campaigning for fair pay and equal treatment, the organization has since grown into one of America's largest, most respected national membership organizations of working women. They've worked for and won major national policies, including the the Family Medical Leave Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. They advocate for paid sick days, equal pay, fair policies around maternity leave, and a strong safety net — all in an effort to lift up the voices of women in low-wage jobs, build their leadership and empower them to bring about real change.",

From there, micronutrient deficiencies are identified and recommendations are made — like which foods should be fortified, with which micronutrients, and at what quantities. The result is wide-scale implementation of efficient, life-saving food fortification programs with a measurable impact on the overall well-being of communities.",

Just a few examples of their work: daily creative workshops, artists-in-residency programs, thoughtful mentorship from locally-based volunteers, and outreach programs targeted at youth with open court cases.",
